        <p>From the beginning of IXDS 2 I set out to talk to some of my old professors again to see if they could help
          out with aspects of the project that were out of my comfort zone, like physical computing and 3D printing.
          This would eventually evolve into a full-fledge collaboration with multiple IXD profs with varying areas of
          expertise. I even managed to break out of IXD and collaborate with Scot Laughton, the program co-ordinator of
          Industrial Design.</p>

        <p>After spending some time researching users and the problem space further, I realized that this wouldn't be
          enough for a project of this type.</p>
        <p>I needed to consult real people and ideally involve them in the design process instead of just consulting
          them from time to time. This is how I met my primary collaborator, R.M. He is part of the primary audience
          that I identified and knowledgeable about the types of assistive devices that already exist. <span

        <p>Testing conducted in-class with sighted participants.</p>
        <p>They were blindfolded, handed the cane, then provided with instructions on how to use the cane. Their goal
          was to navigate the classroom using the cane in a traditional manner and also with the sensor module.</p>
        <p>This was a Wizard of Oz prototype, so the functionality of the device was faked using a custom soundboard
          that stood in for the built-in haptics that would otherwise be providing feedback to the user.</p>

        <p>I knew that this project would end up being expansive from the moment I started planning it. Thesis was
          something that I’ve thought about endlessly since my first day in this program and I’ve spent that whole time
          building up ideas for what topics I wanted to explore and how I wanted to structure the entire project. I’ve
          always viewed myself as a multidisciplinary designer and I knew early on that I wanted my thesis project to
          reflect that.</p>
        <p>That’s the main insight that I’ve gained after I had a chance to reflect on the entire experience. I’d spent
          so much time in previous years thinking about the dimensions I could add to my project that even though I
          didn’t explicitly plan a multidisciplinary approach at the beginning of last semester, the project morphed
          into that anyway. I ended up drawing on many of the experiences that I’ve gained throughout the program,
          ranging from visual design to research, user testing, physical computing, speculative design, prototyping,
          coding, and much more. Thesis also served as an opportunity to further explore skills that I’d just started to
          learn or hadn’t had a chance to yet. I’m content with this because to me it means that I’ve internalized
          enough of the traits and skills I knew I needed to become a multidisciplinary designer that it’s now an
          automatic background process. I’ve reached critical mass with this endeavour, I don’t have to explicitly train
          or study for it anymore. I’ve built up the unconscious processes and habits to operate this way. I’ve faked it
          enough to make it, and now I get to make it again and again.</p>
        <p>Another insight that I uncovered towards the end of thesis was just how collaborative this project ended up
          being and how much I’ve progressed with my social anxiety, public speaking, empathy, and other interpersonal
          skills in these past few years that I was able to successfully seek out collaborators to help me pull this off
          while juggling everything else that was going on in my day-to-day life. I never pictured that part of it when
          I tried to imagine what working away at a year-long thesis project would be like in 1st year. I didn’t realize
          that I’ve been making good progress with my interpersonal skills as well this whole time, from interacting
          with faculty and students at Sheridan as part of my IxDA duties to networking with professionals at large
          design events. Once again this part of the project became almost an automatic process for me as I had already
          built not only the habits but also the networks to seek out compatible collaborators who I knew would be able
          to help me bring my thesis up a notch.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, there remain quite a few areas of improvement that I need to keep working on as I
          transition away from a student towards a junior or senior designer. I’ve learned that while my time/project
          management has improved lately, it needs to be even better if I intend on pursuing projects of this nature or
          collaborating at a larger scale in the future. The planning that I did for myself was somewhat effective, but
          I still ran out of time and resources on more than one occasion. I had to adjust my scope multiple times
          throughout the year, and not always because I had made progress or found insight, but rather because what I
          was trying to do was no longer feasible with my time and resources. I also came face-to-face with more risks
          than I thought I would. Things like not having enough people to test my prototypes with, technology problems
          (things like 3D scanning and printing not panning out as I’d hoped), and illness that would push back my
          schedule by a week or more. The final insight that I learned near the final stages of the project was how
          important strong presentations were, and how much I’d been neglecting that. I thought like a designer and thus
          believed that any fellow designer would immediately understand my project and have a positive perception of
          it. I learned that not only is this an unrealistic expectation towards designers, but that non-designers (or
          really anyone previously unfamiliar with my project) would have an even harder time understanding what I was
          doing. It wouldn’t be enough to just throw all my research and process up on the screen and guide them through
          a chronological summary of it. I had to take the time to understand my audience and cater the content towards
          them. I had to find a format/framework to organize my work with and craft a narrative that would familiarize a
          new audience to my ideas, processes, research, and goals rather than alienating them.</p>
        <p>Going back to my project planning, I think that ultimately it provide me with the opportunity to gracefully
          wrap up this project at the end when I felt like I was running on fumes and had begun to lost sight of why I
          wanted to do this project in the first place. My initial planning around having a roadmap and several
          milestones or tiers I could reach ensured that I could pick the most feasible one in the final weeks of the
          semester and aim to have my project done according to those success metrics instead of letting myself burn
          out.</p>
